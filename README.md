Huffman,Shannon fano,Adaptive Huffman Encoding in MATLAB

### Huffman Encoding

- File named "Huffman.m" is main script for Huffman Encoding.It call a function "binaryHuffman.m" which is responsible for encoding.

### Shanon Fano Encoding

- Fie named "sanen.m" is main script which call function "ShannonFano.m" which will do encoding.

### Adaptive Huffman Encoding

- File named "Adhuff.m" is main script which call function "AdaptiveHuffman.m" for encoding.
- "HNode.m"  defines tree properties and create nodes in tree dynamically.Here Dynamically means the way your input stream arrives.For more details,read how Adaptive Huffman Encoding works. 
- "HNode.m" should be created as "Class" not as a "Script" in MATLAB.  
  
    
    

Once read the algorithms before writing the code.
